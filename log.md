Finished analyzing the usage of Flexbox in the layout of the sample website.

Reviewed command line basics.
- Figured out (AGAIN) the importance of distinguishing between relative paths and absolute paths.
- Understood what is home directory and root directory in perspective of terminal.

Set up browserSync package from scratch.
- Made it possible to watch multiple html docs (with separate tasks).
- Set up a basic startup working file.

Played with Flexbox.
- Tried to figure out how flexbox works.
- Analyzed structure of [the sample website](https://wonma.github.io/trillo/) I built a month ago, focusing primarily on the usage of flexbox. (halfway done.)

As far as I figured, Flexbox is generally about how you put things in "one line" either in a row or in a column. It's like a column flex in a row flex in a column flex etc...
